# Path Finding Visualiser Team-The Mars Hackers

Our aim of the project is to build a Web-App to help a Mars Rover to find the shortest path .

## Algorithms used to find the path:

**Astar** : It is a weighted algorithm that uses heuristic functions to find the shortest path. A* works by making a lowest-cost path tree from the start node to the target node. What makes A* different and better for many searches is that for each node, Astar uses a function f(n) that gives an estimate of the total cost of a path using that node.It uses a heap for implementation.
**Bidirectional Astar** : It searches from both sides.
**Best First Search** : It is an unweighted algorithm.
**Breadth First Search**
**Depth First Search**
**Dijkstra**
**IDAstar**
**Jump Point Search**
**Trace**
