# Path Finding Visualiser Team-The Mars Hackers

Our aim of the project is to build a Web-App to help a Mars Rover to find the shortest path .

## Algorithms used to find the path:

**Astar** : It is a weighted algorithm that uses heuristic functions to find the shortest path. A* works by making a lowest-cost path tree from the start node to the target node. What makes A* different and better for many searches is that for each node, Astar uses a function f(n) that gives an estimate of the total cost of a path using that node.It uses a heap for implementation.

**Best First Search** : It is an unweighted algorithm.It is the combination of depth-first search and breadth-first search algorithms. It uses the heuristic function and search.

**Breadth First Search** : It starts at the start node, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

**Depth First Search** : The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking.
